**GA CHAT - SEI GROUP PROJECT - README**

## GA CHAT is a group project completed by Ryan Xin, Swaroop Bajra and Jamil Samarani during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course.

GA CHAT is a live messaging app which allows users to message each other in real time. Users can log in securely, search for users by name, make and accept friendship requests and view the profiles of other users. Once a friendship request has been accepted, the users are able to message each other directly.

## The GA CHAT app can be accessed via the following link:
https://ga-chat.herokuapp.com/

The code is also available on Github https://github.com/jamsec12ty/ga-chat
